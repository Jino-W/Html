- localStorage:
    -> Cookies and local storage serve different purposes. 
    -> Cookies are mainly for reading server-side, whereas local storage can only be read by the client-side . 
    -> Apart from saving data, a big technical difference is the size of data you can store, and as I mentioned earlier localStorage gives you more to work with.
    -> Local storage lets a site save up to five megabytes (5MB) of data to a user's computer. That data can be accessed using JavaScript from any other page on the same site
    -> localStorage has no expiration time 
    -> It is an object available to us in browser level  (StorageÂ {name: "virat", fruit: "mango", length: 2})

    -> Methods: setItem(key, value), getItem(key), clear(), removeItem(key), key(index) 


- session storage:
    -> With session storage, the data disappears when the browser window is closed.
